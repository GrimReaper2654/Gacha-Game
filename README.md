# Gacha-Game
My friend (Eric) was angry since he couldn't get the good character in Honkai Star Rail (idk what character it was). So I decided to code my own gacha game for him so he could feel the satisfaction of pulling op characters. This is also a good opportunity for me to try making a multiplayer game and not rely on js canvas too heavily. Ignore the anime girl theme, Eric is into that kind of stuff. Also almost all images are AI generated (thanks Bing image generator).<br><br>
Update 1: I despise css.<br>

Don't tell Eric that the rng is rigged against him. Its impossible to pull any of the EX ranked characters lmao.
