# Gacha-Game
My friend (E\*\*\*) was angry since he couldn't get the good character in Honkai Star Rail (idk what character it was). So I decided to code my own gacha game for him so he could feel the satisfaction of pulling op characters. This is also a good opportunity for me to try making a multiplayer game and not rely on js canvas too heavily. Ignore the anime girl theme, E\*\*\* is into that kind of stuff. Also almost all images are AI generated (thanks Bing image generator).<br><br>
**Plot:**<br>
The protagonist, Eco, eats too much food and falls through spacetime due to his insane density, the godess saves him by sending him ot another world. Eco must defeat the demon lord in order to return to his origional word. Along the way, he will need to gain companions and beat dungeons. (maximum cringe plotline requested by E\*\*\*)

Don't tell E\*\*\* that the rng is rigged against him. Its impossible to pull any of the EX ranked characters lmao.
